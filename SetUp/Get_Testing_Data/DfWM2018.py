"""
DfEM2020: prepare the dataset of EM2020, such it can be evaluated.
The dataset is manipulated, such that it only contains shots, and no other events.
Shots from penalties, free kicks and headers are not taken into account, since they distort the picture.
The dataset of the shot events is joined with the dataset of the according match.
Like this we have additional information about the game.
Additionally the dataset is manipulated, such that 4 additional rows are created (x, y, angle, distance).
Angle calculates the open angle from the striker to the goal.
Distance calculates the distance from the striker to the goal centre.
the manipulated dataset is saved in a JSON format.
